    <h1>Pain, Trains and Automobiles</h1>
    <body>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 6:30 AM. Streetlights reveal the facades of buildings and empty streets in Maspeth, Queens. A sleeping urban giant, Maspeth is a wild collage of brick warehouses, bodegas, dimly lit bridges, and blocks of multifamily residentials. The omnipresent metal rollup doors covering storefronts are deceiving — in just a few hours, Maspeth will become a bustling center for mom and pop stores and other small businesses. For now, though, the streets are vacant, as students and workers have already exited their apartment buildings in droves to shuffle off to their respective bus and subway stations. 
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Cut to a few blocks south of Grand Central. It’s 7:30 AM now, and the streets are alive with movement, accompanied by an unstoppable white noise of cars and people. Manhattan feels the full force of the wrath of drowsy drivers and drowsier pedestrians. Not too far underground, subway stations are getting hotter as the MTA deals with its daily dose of human packing problems and delays in subway service.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Cut again, to a location five hundred and forty miles away from New York. It is 8:00 AM and the sun is shining over farmland and cows in Licking County, Ohio. All the driveways are empty, with its residents having already driven to work or school. Beautiful fall foliage covers asphalt roads ridden with potholes and cracks.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp According to the MTA, New York’s public transportation system has existed for 120 years, boasting a fleet of around 6,000 subways running over 850 miles of track stretching from Staten Island all the way into Connecticut. It is by no means a perfect system, but it’s the lifeblood of New York, carrying over 14 million people around the city every day. Licking County, on the other hand, once had a trolley system in the 1800s.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Chris and Jane, two fellow Hunter seniors, are two of 14 million MTA daily users, but they aren’t happy about it. “I rely heavily on the MTA for transportation,” Chris says. This is true — Chris, a Maspeth resident, spends about twelve hours a week commuting on public transportation to get to school and other extracurriculars. Their reliance on the MTA, however, is less of a symbiotic relationship and can be better described as a reluctant compromise. Chris complains about its filth, poor management, and lack of safety measures, but it is ultimately the fastest and easiest way for them to get around town.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Jane, a resident of lower Manhattan, shares the same sentiment. She lives about a five-minute walk away from Grand Central, a crossroads of multiple subway, bus, and train lines. As someone with easy access to this central hub of transportation, she only spends around thirty minutes commuting each day to other places in Manhattan, which is substantially below the city average. Surveys led by Newsday reveal that 28% percent of New Yorkers take around one to two hours to get to work each day, making New York public transit the slowest in the nation. Perpetually sluggish service is detrimental to those who live further away from their public transit destinations. Chris, for instance, has had to give up multiple volunteering opportunities since attending Hunter simply due to how long it took to take the subway home, while their peers who remained in Queens have many hours for post-school activities. “Every month, someone dies on the R train and the train gets delayed,” Chris laments.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Delays are an increasingly pressing issue for the MTA, especially with its crumbling decades-old infrastructure. Recent flooding from Tropical Storm Ophelia revealed the subway system’s weakness to large amounts of rain. According to the Gothamist, despite the MTA’s best attempts at improving their water pumping technology, it still took days for the subway system to fully restore service. Even without water damage, the archaic code that controls the MTA subway signal system is prone to failure, leading to a constant lack of information provided to riders, as well as unnecessary pauses in service. Internal MTA documents released by the New York Times in 2018 revealed that signals were originally implemented to prevent trains from moving too fast, but the prevalence of faulty signals often causes subways to brake automatically even if they are below the speed limit. Just one faulty signal has the potential to back up an entire line of subways, causing not only delays but also extreme crowding in the subway cars.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Despite Jane’s shorter commute, which is less prone to such technical difficulties, she is still extremely displeased with the quality of public transportation. Like many other New Yorkers, she is wary of the cleanliness of subway and bus stations. “I’d like more information from the government about how they clean the trains,” she says. Her apprehension towards hygiene in New York subway stations are not unfounded. Studies from 2021 conducted by environmental health scientists at New York University reveal that subway stations in New York have abnormally high concentrations of particulate matter -- microscopic particles that can cause health complications. In fact, readings they recorded surpassed the World Health Organization’s recommendations for daily exposure to particulate matter. Even on the macroscopic scale, subway and bus stations are overrun with stains from unknown sources, rodents, and various bodily wastes.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Both Chris and Jane welcome a world in which they do not have to rely on public transport to get around New York, at least, not in the current state that it is in. Chris would much rather be able to drive to avoid the bus and subway stations that they describe as a “well-lit sewer” but are limited by the fact that they don’t have a driver’s license and are equally unwilling to brave the wild frontiers of Manhattan traffic. Jane is even willing to sacrifice some sleep if it means that she would be able to take the car to school instead of the crowded 6 train, but is prevented by her lack of a car. Both of them acknowledge that driving to the places that they need to get to every day is impractical — while comfortable, it would simply be too expensive. “I would have to spend a lot of money on a car, which means that my parents would not be able to spend that money on my college tuition,” Jane contemplated, before going off on a long winded tangent about the affordability of healthcare.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Audrey, a senior at Granville High School and proud Licking County inhabitant, has the opposite problem. Her issues with her commute are not a result of public transport, but rather poorly maintained automobile infrastructure. Without having any public transportation, most of Licking County’s residents rely exclusively on automobiles for transportation; in fact, Audrey’s high school has annual “Drive Your Tractor To School” days. Audrey admits that although she enjoys driving for long distances while blasting Devo or Car Seat Headrest, her reliance on cars is a serious issue.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Aside from going to school, she also relies on her car to make the 45-minute drive to her job in Columbus, as there is no other way to get there. She spends a total of around eight hours driving each week, which is incredibly taxing, both physically and mentally. Furthermore, her ability to drive also depends on the weather — poorly maintained roads make it nigh impossible to drive during heavy rain or the winter, and the lack of streetlights make driving during the nighttime a terrifying experience. “[Public transportation] would make my life a lot easier if it existed,” she sighed, when dreaming about such a future.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Recent efforts undertaken by the Ohio Department of Transportation and Licking County Transit Authority have sought to bring public transportation into reality. New initiatives have begun providing buses for the elderly and disabled to take them around the greater Newark area. Programs like this are incredibly beneficial to people like Audrey’s grandmother, who is unable to drive because of vision problems and therefore has no other way to get around. However, the lack of accessibility of public transportation to other demographics is still prevalent, especially among Audrey’s peers. Some of her classmates live too far from school to walk and rely on their parents to drive them. Their ability to do extracurricular activities is limited by their parents’ work schedules, as they are only able to commute when their parents are free.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Audrey speculates that if she had some way to take a bus or train into Columbus, she would definitely go to Columbus more often for extracurricular activities because she wouldn’t have to spend as much money on gasoline and the commute would be much less tiring. Additionally, she would also be able to repurpose her commute time to doing schoolwork instead of paying attention to the road.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Concerns and complaints raised by Chris, Jane, and Audrey reveal a pressing need for improvements and more investment in public transportation infrastructure throughout the United States. Clearly, residents of both urban and rural areas are eager for more reliable and accessible transportation. In a time when the entire world is so connected and the resources for more efficient and sustainable public transportation is feasible, the painstakingly long commutes experienced by Chris, Jane, and Audrey could all be alleviated. However, a future in which American public transportation systems are improved upon appears to be a stretch. For now, they will have to continue daydreaming in their buses, trains, and cars about being somewhere else, perhaps with “Whip It” playing in the background.
