I Watched Jeffrey Lewis Today

I watched Jeffrey Lewis today, live in a small space in Troy comparable to the big spaces that try to look like small spaces in Brooklyn. I smiled so hard when I walked in I nearly cried, I was so excited. But I held it in because I was saving my tears for when Jeffrey Lewis played a sad song like "Back When I Was Four". He didn't but I wouldn't have know that yet. I watched him walk out the venue a few minutes before the soundcheck ended and he complimented my friend's shirt, who responded by asking who he was.

The opening band was a group of five middle-aged men called Pony in the Pancake. The lead guitarist looked like a lankier Theo Katzman and had a pedalboard that must have cost upwards of $2000 but he played about five notes in each song. The lead singer introduced each song as if ashamed or afraid that we would not like it and leave. He played songs about holdings hands with loved ones in a forest and purchasing a boat in every ocean in the world, big concepts that I could not relate to personally but he sang and played with such passion, back bent like a big middle-aged shrimp, that I believed that I had done those very same things. They were seriously awesome.

One member of Grasping Straws played singer-songwriter music like I had never heard and I did not like it personally but I respect her very much for doing something completely new and intentionally strange. 

Jeffrey Lewis came on stage and played and I hope he noticed the skinny Asian kid with the dumbest big grin or biggest dumb grin in the front row, eyes locked on him.
