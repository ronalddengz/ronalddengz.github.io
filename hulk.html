    <h1>An Analysis of Immortal Hulk and Invisible Man</h1>
    <body>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<i>Immortal Hulk</i> is a 50-issue comic run on Marvel’s Hulk by Al Ewing. The series takes a more philosophy-driven approach to Bruce Banner and the Hulk's story, exploring the psychological and supernatural aspects of the characters. It also introduces the concept of the Green Door, which serves as a literal entryway into the minds of those affected by gamma radiation, who are referred to as “gamma mutates.” Bruce’s dissociative identity disorder is especially emphasized, and multiple personalities of the Hulk appear, each one representing a different aspect of Bruce’s identity. Devil Hulk is the manifestation of the darkest thoughts Bruce had as a child. It presents itself as the protective father figure Bruce wishes he had. Savage Hulk is the less intelligent, childlike Hulk that embodies Bruce’s repressed childhood depression and longing for the love of his abusive father, Brian Banner. Finally, the Grey Hulk, who goes by the name Joe Fixit, is a cunning, selfish Hulk who values material possessions greatly and was once a Las Vegas casino boss. Aside from the Hulk, there are two other major gamma mutates: Brian Banner and Samuel Sterns. Brian Banner believed his son’s intelligence made him a freak of nature, resulting in a constant onslaught of verbal and physical abuse. Samuel Sterns, Bruce’s second cousin, gains supernatural intelligence after a freak accident involving gamma radiation and begins referring to himself as the Leader. He learns how to open, close, and enter the Green Doors of other gamma mutates, taking over their bodies.

        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor this project, I looked at the theme of “authoring your own identity,” which I interpreted as gaining individuality and taking as much control over one’s own destiny as they can. Ewing explores this theme through Bruce’s interactions with the Banners and the multiple identities of the Hulk. The series includes two major conflicts. First, there is abundant infighting between Bruce’s multiple personalities, with each of them attempting to gain dominance over the others. As the series progresses, the different Hulks begin to collaborate more, as they all try to be better people and start helping the innocent instead of accomplishing their own agendas. Second, the Leader takes control over the bodies of some of the Hulks via his newfound connection to the Green Door. However, when the Hulk personalities begin to collaborate, they finally become strong enough to defeat the Leader and take back their free will.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMuch like <i>Immortal Hulk</i>, the main character of Ralph Ellison’s <i>Invisible Man</i> also goes through multiple different identities. The narrator begins as a naïve optimist—a young and ambitious Black man full of misguided hope. He believes that hard work and education alone will eventually lead to his acceptance in society. From the quote “But more than that, [Bledsoe] was the example of everything I hoped to be: Influential with wealthy men all over the country; consulted in matters concerning the race; a leader of his people; the possessor of not one, but two Cadillacs, a good salary and a soft, good-looking and creamy-complexioned wife.” (79), it is clear that the narrator associates material possessions and appearance with success. He fails to understand that Bledsoe had to become the white man’s “ideal” Black person to get to where he is now—someone who is willing to ignore the suffering of others in his community as long as he can make more money. This is best exemplified when he berates the narrator for showing a white trustee of the college Jim Trueblood’s living quarters. By idolizing Bledsoe, the narrator is nearly manipulated into remaining silent about the struggles of his people. 
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen the narrator joins the Brotherhood, he takes on the identity of a dedicated political activist and is told that he can achieve his goals through unwavering loyalty to the collective goals of the Brotherhood and by abandoning individual thought. Witnessing the narrator’s power as an orator, the Brotherhood takes advantage of his idealism and desire for social change, using him as a spokesperson for their own selfish agenda of gaining a spot on the national political stage. In the interest of the Brotherhood, Brother Jack forbids the narrator from writing to his family because “‘much of our work is opposed. Our discipline demands therefore that we talk to no one and that we avoid situations in which information might be given away unwittingly.’” (239) The narrator is forcibly cut off from his past life and identity in his efforts to free himself from the systemic racism in his society.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThroughout <i>Immortal Hulk</i>, the Hulks and Bruce are both manipulated multiple times. Like the narrator admiring Bledsoe, when Savage Hulk attempts to earn the love of Brian Banner (who is being controlled by the Leader,) he easily falls for Brian’s emotional exploitation and is taken captive by the Leader. Savage Hulk tries to appease the demands of an oppressive authority figure and ends up losing his free will. In a separate incident, Devil Hulk comes to the conclusion that humanity as a whole is the source of constant persecution against Hulk and Bruce. He declares war on the human race, but his judgment is clouded by his immense rage and he is also easily captured by the Leader. Just like the narrator’s collaboration with the uncaring Brotherhood, Devil Hulk’s misplaced hatred in his battle against his oppressors causes him to lose his freedom as well. 
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the end of <i>Invisible Man</i>, the narrator forges himself into the Invisible Man, a creation entirely of his own, without the influence of anyone else, such as Bledsoe or the Brotherhood—“And my problem was that I always tried to go in everyone’s way but my own. I have also been called one thing and then another while no one really wished to hear what I called myself. So after years of trying to adopt the opinions of others I finally rebelled. I am an invisible man.” (447) This is when the narrator is the most powerful, because he has discovered the ability to become invisible and stay in his hole, where he is free to live outside the control of others. At the end of Immortal Hulk, all of the Hulk identities realize that they need each other to exist. Just like the Invisible Man, no one identity of the Hulk is enough to survive. Each Hulk (and Bruce) brings an integral part to Bruce’s overall personality—Devil Hulk’s assertiveness, Savage Hulk’s innocence and drive to do good, Joe Fixit’s cunning, and Bruce’s intelligence and rationale. Only when they work together are they able to regain control over their Green Doors from the Leader. However, when given the opportunity to kill the Leader, Hulk spares him. Hulk is labeled as a multitude of things, like “man,” “monster,” or “breaker.” What he is is a continually changed beast—his past does not define him. Despite the generational hate and rage stemming back to Bruce’s father or the public’s insistence that he is a mindless brute, Hulk has the ability to choose mercy; he can decide to be good and he does not need his rage to be strong. Rather, his strength comes from his ability to ignore the labels others put on him and make his own path. 
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy analysis of <i>Immortal Hulk</i> and <i>Invisible Man</i> reveals how commonly literature concerning American society grapples with the theme of identity. Both pieces of work show their protagonists struggle to define themselves under expectations foisted upon them by others, and ultimately achieve success when they are able to shed those expectations altogether. None of them are able to be defined by a single thing, be it “Black man” or “monster,” because to be American is to be the product of a myriad of backgrounds and identities.
