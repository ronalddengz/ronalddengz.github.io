Polyrhythmic marching rings through the dark,
A jagged pulse to a blind singerâ€™s songs.
In school today,
We studied lines.
She solemnly wields her tin in the park.
Concrete colossi with their jagged prongs,
A line took me to
See you the other day.
I was watching a pigeon today,
Tear the night to show a marquee of stars.
Businessmen do their geometric dance:
But I guess we live
In parallel lines.
It pecked at food scraps on the highway
They waltz through fog and exhaust and cigars
To the cries of cars and talks of finance.
I saw strangers
That day as well.
But all of the cars,
Below, the rats run in frantic patterns.
Pompous buskers and flamenco footsteps
And I saw them
the day before, too.
And screams from afar,
Linger through the halls and rest in tatters
Amidst torn advertisements and held breaths.
Nameless, all of them.
But the lines in their faces,
Coult not seem to drive it away.
Streetlights flicker and shine brilliantly;
They light up this mad shoegaze symphony.
They go in every which way
And collide with me.
